A simple ruby script to manage config files.

The config file has two sections namely content and config separated by a delimiter (__CONFIG__). The content section could have simple template varibles of the the sytle %VARNAME%, for which the values are provided on the config section.

The config section has a env key which manages how many environments the files need to be generated for. The vars property on the section has the values of the property for different environments.
